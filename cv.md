PostgreSql was used as a database. Hibernate as a JPA provider. DAO/Repository level was implemented with a help of Spring Data JPA firstly but then got rid of it and migrated to clean JPA. Designed and implemented numerous REST APIs. Integrated Swagger and covered all the necessary api endpoints with appropriate documentation.
