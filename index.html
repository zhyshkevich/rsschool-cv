            <p>A backend development team member. A project I’ve been working on is a central banking processing unit. Participated in the whole development cycle from scratch. Designed and implemented a classic clean three-layer architecture: Repository level, Service layer, Controller layer.
            Since the system followed the database-first approach, actively worked with DB-developers: creating complex sql-queries, analyzing the existing ones and improve them using sql-plans and debugging. PostgreSql was used as a database. Hibernate as a JPA provider. DAO/Repository level was implemented with a help of Spring Data JPA firstly but then got rid of it and migrated to clean JPA.
            Designed and implemented numerous REST APIs. Integrated Swagger and covered all the necessary api endpoints with appropriate documentation. Covered all the necessary pieces of the system with appropriate documentation.</p>

            <p><u>Responsibilities:</u> development, testing and integration of core modules and components. Refactoring of the existing. Specification and documentation creation. Code-review.</p>

                As a database PostgreSQL was used. Hibernate as a JPA provider. DAO/Repository level was implemented with a help of Spring Data JPA. Actively used Spring Data JPA’s Specifications, 
                Predicates, Queries as well as native sql queries, Java 8’s features as lambdas, streams to implement the desired business logic.</p>

                <li><strong>Python Developer. Master diploma project.</strong></li>
                <p>The main goal of the project was to develop a system for automation of a process of detecting free parking slots based on a live-stream video using deep learning with an ability to send notifications to an end user when a parking slot becomes free.
                    MASK-R CNN was used as a base convolutional neural network. COCO dataset was used in order to train model. 
                    Reinforcement learning technique was used in order to achieve better recognition results for the chosen recognition objects. 
                    As a end-user platform Telegram messenger was chosen. OpenCV library was chosen to handle video frames and other different routine. 
                    A telegram bot application was developed for receiving notifications from the recognition module. 
                    The result architecture contained 3 main modules: the recognition module, the logging module, the notification module. 
                    The result system is able to detect the following transport objects: a motorcycle, a car, a truck. The result achieved recognition accuracy is approximately 95%.</p>
